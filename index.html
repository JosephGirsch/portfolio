									<h2>After Repair Value<br />
									Prediction Tool</a></h2>
									<p>This project will predict the After-Repair Values of properties in a database by using a series of processing steps.
										The scripts in this repo will load real estate data from a remote SQL data base (alternatively an option to load from CSVs), 
										call the Census Data API to obtain their census tracts, enhance a binary renovation classification model by converting 
										descriptive text into variables using a Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency matrix, and use a regression model to 
										predict the After-Repair Values of each property.<br />
										 *Patent Pending* <br />

										<h2>Baltimore Citations Web Scraper</a></h2>
									</header>
									<a class="image fit"><img src="images/Baltimore_Scraper_Merged_Image.bmp" alt="" /></a>
									<p>This web scraper loops through the property citations for each neighborhood in Baltimore City and 
										stores them in an excel file. The scrapped results were used to conduct a 6-month marketing campaign 
										to the investor owners as part of the wholesaling business that my partner and I conducted from September 
										2021 to February 2022. We found that owners of vacant properties with multiple citations were
										more likely to sell to investors. More information is available in the repo README file.  </p>

										<h2><a href="#">Baltimore Real Estate Investor Tracts</a></h2>
									</header>
									<a class="image fit"><img src="images/Tableau_project_image_border2.png" alt="" /></a>
									<p>This Tableau presentation is the culmination of an extensive data analysis project
										on individual Maryland property records aggregated and supplemented with other public sources.
										The goal of the analysis was to quantitatively identify the 
										census tracts in Maryland that were optimal for property flipping (green tracts). 
										Metrics for identifying	areas non-conducive for real estate investing such as
										high crime areas (red tracts) or affluent areas (yellow tracts) were developed 
										using redfin data, zillow API, government census data, and price metrics. 
										Threshold tuning was optimized and validated with the help of local investors.
										Metrics requested by investors are displayed on mouseover for each census tract. 
										<!-- Data was obtained from Redfin, individual property rental data from Zillow's API (now defunct),
										and Census Tract data from the Maryland's GIS Data Catalog -->

										<h2><a href="#">Offer Evaluator for Investor Deals</a></h2>
									</header>
									<a class="image fit"><img src="images/OfferEvaluatorTool.JPG" alt="" /></a>
									<p>
									This offer evaluator will calculator for the investor-user the Maximum Allowable Offer (MAO) that they should
									make for an investment property that requires repairs. Through repeated practice in evaluating properties using
									the comp analysis method, I found that price adjustments based on differences in comp attributes could be 
									consistently predicted on a percentage basis (For example, a property with a 1-car garage is consistently 
									3% more expensive than an equivalent property with no garage). I documented the percentage gains of the most 
									important of these attributes and implemented them in an easy-to-fill out grid to help investors determine
									the maximum offer price for their investment deals.  </p>

										<h2><a href="#">Kingdom Investors Club (Cohost) </a></h2>
									</header>
									<a class="image fit"><img src="images/Kingdom Builders.png" alt="" /></a>
									<p>My partner and I hosted the Kingdom Investors Club starting in January 2022. Together, we
									used his background in the property flipping business and my background in data analytics to build a
									a framework of investing principles and document them in a curriculum format. We shared this framework to 
									our local church community where we presented our findings and supported them with synergistic 
									biblical principles.
